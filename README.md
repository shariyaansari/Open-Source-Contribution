## How to View the Slides

You have a few options to view the presentation:

### Option 1: In VS Code (Recommended for Developers)

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed.
3.  Install the **[Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode)** extension.
4.  Open the presentation.md file in VS Code.
5.  Click the "Open Preview" icon to see the slides rendered perfectly.

### Option 2: On GitHub

You can view the presentation.md file directly on GitHub. However, it will be rendered as a standard markdown document, *not* as a slideshow. This is useful for a quick look at the content.
